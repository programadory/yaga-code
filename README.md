# Optimized code, using better function to saver space and memory.

# Implemment pointers in the future, cast with enum type. For now is finished.

# Problem when passing 0 arguments (segment fault erorr) solved.
# Cmatrix option implemented yaga [matrix]


# ---Tips and learning I did get.

# strcmp() return trash from memory if you doesn use the variables itself. if a variable have trash in it strcmp cannot process this data and it will return a segmentation fault. May C++17 cannot handle with that ? is there another way to do that cuz I see compare char* direct from statements ain't possible.
